# Security Risk Analysis

This document outlines the security risks identified in the real-time Google Sheets integration system at both infrastructure and code levels, along with recommendations for mitigation.

## Infrastructure Level Risks

### 1. Overly Permissive Security Groups
- The ElastiCache security group allows access from the entire 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block
- The ECS security group allows all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0)
- **Mitigation**: Restrict security groups to only necessary traffic using specific CIDR blocks and ports

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials
- The `ExternalSourcesConfig` parameter contains a default value with a hardcoded bearer token
- Sensitive credentials should never be stored in CloudFormation templates
- **Mitigation**: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for credential management

### 3. Public IP Assignment
- ECS tasks are configured with `AssignPublicIp: ENABLED`, exposing them to the internet
- This increases the attack surface unnecessarily
- **Mitigation**: Use private subnets with NAT Gateway for outbound traffic

### 4. Missing API Gateway Authorization
- No authorization is defined for the WebSocket API
- Anyone can connect to the WebSocket endpoint
- **Mitigation**: Implement AWS Cognito or custom authorizers for WebSocket connections

### 5. Missing Resource Policies
- SQS queues lack resource policies to restrict access
- DynamoDB tables rely solely on IAM roles without fine-grained access controls
- **Mitigation**: Implement resource policies and condition-based access controls

### 6. Insufficient Network Isolation
- No VPC endpoint configurations for AWS services
- Services are potentially exposed to the public internet
- **Mitigation**: Implement VPC endpoints for AWS services to keep traffic within AWS network

### 7. Missing Encryption in Transit
- No explicit configuration for HTTPS/TLS for API Gateway
- No encryption configuration for SQS messages
- **Mitigation**: Enable encryption in transit for all services and enforce TLS 1.2+

## Code Level Risks

### 1. Input Validation
- No validation for external source URLs in the monitoring service
- Potential for SSRF attacks if malicious URLs are provided
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict URL validation and allowlisting

### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Using older Node.js runtime (nodejs14.x) which may have security vulnerabilities
- No mechanism for updating dependencies when vulnerabilities are discovered
- **Mitigation**: Use the latest Node.js runtime and implement regular dependency scanning

### 3. Insufficient Error Handling
- Error handling in Lambda function may expose sensitive information
- No rate limiting for failed authentication attempts
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### 4. Data Sanitization
- No sanitization of data from external sources before storing in DynamoDB
- Potential for injection attacks or storage of malicious content
- **Mitigation**: Implement input sanitization for all external data

### 5. Secrets Management
- API keys and tokens are stored directly in environment variables
- No integration with AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- **Mitigation**: Use AWS Secrets Manager for all credentials and API keys

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- Basic CloudWatch logging without structured logging for security events
- No alerting for suspicious activities or failed operations
- **Mitigation**: Implement structured logging and set up alerts for security events

### 7. WebSocket Connection Management
- No mechanism to validate the origin of WebSocket connections
- No rate limiting for connection attempts
- **Mitigation**: Implement origin validation and rate limiting for WebSocket connections

### 8. Missing Authentication for Admin Operations
- No authentication for operations that modify data
- Potential for unauthorized data manipulation
- **Mitigation**: Implement authentication for all admin operations

## Recommended Security Improvements

### Short-term Improvements
1. Update IAM policies to follow least privilege principle
2. Move credentials to AWS Secrets Manager
3. Implement basic input validation for all external data
4. Enable encryption in transit for all services
5. Update to the latest Node.js runtime

### Medium-term Improvements
1. Implement WebSocket API authorization
2. Move ECS tasks to private subnets
3. Restrict security group rules to specific IP ranges
4. Set up CloudWatch alarms for security events
5. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement VPC endpoints for all AWS services
2. Set up automated dependency scanning and updates
3. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy
4. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
5. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for API Gateway
